### Toon Calculator

A calculator for your rooted Eneco Toon so you always have a calculator at hand, well at the wall that is.

<table border = 1 bordercolor ="red" align = center>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
</table>

### Install the app

This app is available in the Toon Store but when you want to do it manually :

    - on Toon create a folder /qmf/qml/apps/calculator
    - put everything of this github repository in it
    - restart the GUI / reboot your Toon
    - add a tile for 'Calculator' ( green circle, white plus )

Thanks for reading and enjoy the calculator.
